= Location Sink =

Window.location (or document.location) and its members can be a source and a sink 
The window.location object can be used to take the browser to another page by simply
assigning a string to it.

Eg.
{{{
window.location = "http://example.com/a/page.ext?par=val#hash"
}}}

== The object assignment == 

 * location
 * location.href
 * location.pathname
 * location.search
 * location.protocol
 * location.hostname

An unvalidated assignment to each of the listed objects could lead,
to some extent, to security issues.
